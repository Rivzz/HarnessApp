Instructions for creation of a pomodoro web application are detailed below:

Goals below MUST be followed in order of listing (top-down)
When goals are accomplished proceed to COMPLETION 

## First Goal

Brainstorm up to 50 test cases for features
A test case -> possible feature for the web application
A test case -> simple goal, specific, can cover multiple aspects of a feature at once
A test case -> ONLY choose features that a user would find necessary in this application

Store test cases and then proceed to Second Goal

## Second Goal

Generation of a features_list.json will take place
features_list.json will follow this format in json architecture:

each object -> has keys {feature_name, goal, priority, state}

feature_name = reference id for feature addition task
goal = instructions for you (the ai) to define additions
priority = set a priority (low, medium, high), order at which task will be completed
state = set a state (standby, in-progress, completed)

## Third Goal

Generate a init.sh with skills required for assembling feature_list.json
Keep it simple, but isolated to web development efficiency

## Fourth Goal

Scaffold project architecture
During Scaffolding if feature in features_list.json is satisfied, reflect this in the feature state.

## Fifth Goal

Initialize the git repository

## COMPLETION

Provide session handoff notes to the next agent in a file claude-progress.txt
