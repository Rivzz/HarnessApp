# Pomodoro Web Application - Session Handoff Notes
# Generated: 2026-02-03

## Session Summary
All five goals from app_spec.txt have been completed successfully.

## Completed Goals

### Goal 1: Test Cases (COMPLETED)
- Created 50 test cases covering all necessary user features
- Stored in: test_cases.txt
- Categories covered: Core Timer, Break Management, Customization, Notifications,
  Task Management, Statistics, UI/UX, Accessibility

### Goal 2: Features List (COMPLETED)
- Generated features_list.json with 38 features
- Each feature has: feature_name, goal, priority, state
- Priority distribution:
  - High: Core timer, controls, breaks, audio notifications, responsive design
  - Medium: Settings, tasks, stats, theme, keyboard shortcuts
  - Low: Advanced stats, drag-drop reordering, fullscreen mode

### Goal 3: Init Script (COMPLETED)
- Created init.sh for development environment setup
- Checks for: Node.js, npm, Git, VS Code, live-server
- Creates project directory structure
- Initializes package.json if missing

### Goal 4: Project Architecture (COMPLETED)
Scaffolded complete project structure:
```
E:/GitHub/HarnessApp/
├── src/
│   ├── index.html          # Main HTML with full UI structure
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── styles.css      # Complete styles with dark/light themes
│   ├── js/
│   │   ├── timer.js        # Timer module (start/pause/reset/auto-transition)
│   │   ├── tasks.js        # Task list module (add/edit/delete/complete)
│   │   ├── settings.js     # Settings persistence and modal
│   │   └── app.js          # Main app initialization and coordination
│   └── assets/
│       ├── sounds/         # For notification sounds
│       └── images/         # For any images/icons
├── package.json            # npm config with dev scripts
├── init.sh                 # Setup script
├── features_list.json      # Feature backlog
├── test_cases.txt          # Test case documentation
└── .gitignore              # Git ignore rules
```

### Goal 5: Git Repository (COMPLETED)
- Initialized empty Git repository
- Added .gitignore for node_modules, IDE files, OS files, etc.
- No initial commit made (left for next agent to commit with meaningful message)

## Current Application State
The application is FUNCTIONAL and ready for testing:
- Timer works with start/pause/reset controls
- Auto-transitions between work/short break/long break sessions
- Settings modal allows customization of all durations
- Dark mode toggle available
- Task list with add/complete/delete functionality
- Daily stats tracking (pomodoros, focus time)
- Keyboard shortcuts (Space=start/pause, R=reset, S=settings)
- Tab title updates with timer countdown
- Sound notifications via Web Audio API
- Browser notification support (requires permission)

## How to Run
1. Navigate to project directory
2. Run: npm start (or npx live-server src --port=3000)
3. Open browser to http://localhost:3000

## Recommended Next Steps for Implementation Agent

### Immediate (Before First Commit)
1. Test all features manually in browser
2. Make initial git commit with all files

### High Priority Features (from features_list.json)
- visual_progress_indicator: Add circular SVG progress ring around timer
- audio_notifications: Add actual audio file sounds (currently uses Web Audio beep)
- state_persistence: Save/restore timer state on page refresh

### Medium Priority Features
- task_pomodoro_estimation: Add estimated pomodoro count to tasks
- session_history: Log completed sessions with timestamps
- weekly_stats: Add weekly statistics view

### Low Priority / Nice-to-Have
- fullscreen_focus_mode: Hide all UI except timer
- stats_visualization: Charts/graphs for productivity trends
- notification_sounds_selection: Multiple sound options

## Known Limitations
1. No cloud sync - all data stored in localStorage only
2. No actual audio files - uses generated Web Audio beep
3. No drag-and-drop task reordering yet
4. Stats reset at midnight but no historical tracking

## Files to Reference
- features_list.json: Full feature backlog with priorities
- test_cases.txt: Original test case brainstorm
- app_spec.txt: Original requirements document

## Technical Notes
- Pure vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Modular architecture (Timer, Tasks, Settings, App modules)
- All modules use IIFE pattern for encapsulation
- LocalStorage used for persistence
